				/// sought. By transparently fulfilling these requests, this class can employ all of
				/// the filtering mechanisms provided to it to filter connections and content on
				/// behalf of the downstream client, before the content reaches the client.
				/// 
				/// It is also the burden of this class, when BridgeSocketType is
				/// network::TlsSocket, to seek and verify SSL certificates before requesting that
				/// the supplied in memory certificate store generate a server context that can be
				/// used to transparently serve the secured client. That is, if a secure client
				/// connects requesting a host for which there is currently no spoofed certificate
				/// and corresponding SSL context, this class has the burden of connecting to the
				/// requested host, fetching the real certificate, verifying it, then and only then
				/// (verified), requesting the supplied in memory store to spoof and generate a
				/// context that this bridge can use.

				/// Since this class enforces TLS when serving a secure client, and parsing SNI is
