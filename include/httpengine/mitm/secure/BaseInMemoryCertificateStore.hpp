				/// certificate, then issuing certificates to clients on demand.

				/// As noted elsewhere in the documentation for this class, care must be taken not
				/// to improperly use this class. Clients absolutely must correctly validate

				/// Failing to do so will result in lying to clients about their security,
				/// potentially issuing a valid spoofed certificate that clients will trust, when in
				/// fact the original certificate is not valid for some reason. Any connection where
				/// an upstream certificate fails the standard validation should be terminated
